00:00:55.983 --> 00:01:02.671
Can you believe in magic and hourglass poetry?

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:07.828
"It's okay now." Two people are here alone

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:16.488
The various temperatures I touched for the first time melted my quivering heart

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:21.755
"It's okay now, eat it before it gets cold."

00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:30.099
Colorless and transparent things are painted on the cheeks
All emotions spill

00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:39.000
You cast a spell on a crybaby that couldn't scream

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:46.764
Parallel lines Flapping butterflies
Connect two dots and dots with you

00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:53.789
I want to be with you  I want to be next to you
no matter what the ending

00:01:53.974 --> 00:02:00.933
What do you want to do with the margin of life?
What do you want to touch with that hand?

00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:08.674
Destiny and fate have nothing to do with us
Shining world

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:31.247
Because you believed in me, the scenery I see is beginning to change color.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.590
"It's okay now." because you're not alone anymore

00:02:38.678 --> 00:02:45.155
I've forgotten how I used to tremble.
Now I find your kindness hot and a little disturbing

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:50.399
"It's okay now. Eat it before it gets cold."

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:58.712
My heart rate goes up
I learned the emotion of love

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:07.901
Life was supposed to be normal for a long time to come
The magic melts away in a cruel way

00:03:26.835 --> 00:03:30.342
Margins that were supposed to be painted are being cut away

00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:34.163
What you touch crumbles from your hands

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.061
The words that I will tell you someday will never reach you

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.851
because my voice has already become hoarse

00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:45.569
There doesn't have to be magic
There doesn't have to be magic

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:49.535
You're all I need
You're all I need

00:03:49.904 --> 00:03:53.321
How many more words can I say about my feelings for you?

00:03:53.747 --> 00:04:00.525
I'm sure... I'll see you again somewhere

00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:09.245
Cherry blossoms swaying in the spring wind
Everyday life, a world where the ordinary is commonplace

00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:15.464
One small footstep signals the dawn.

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:27.096
Parallel lines Fluttering butterflies
When you connect the dots, they Disappearing like a dream

00:04:27.275 --> 00:04:31.144
It is a shining world that no one knows

00:04:34.317 --> 00:04:38.050
It is a certain world that no one knows

00:04:39.534 --> 00:04:52.206
If there was magic in this world, then parallels might cross

00:04:53.442 --> 00:04:59.738
It's a miracle we can laugh at each other and say there's no way that's possible.

00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:07.638
Disappearing like a dream
A shining world that no one knows

00:05:58.035 --> 00:06:04.843
Can you believe in magic and hourglass poetry?

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.311
"It's okay now." Two people are here alone

00:06:10.935 --> 00:06:12.101
just now

00:06:18.226 --> 00:06:24.000
Akane : Hey, if three wishes come true, why do you wish? Actually, I watched a movie yesterday

00:06:24.464 --> 00:06:28.475
Haru : Oh, "Gosenfu to tsuki to affogato"? I also saw

00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:31.993
Akane : I see! Kinagi-kun was really cool, wasn't it?

00:06:35.143 --> 00:06:40.873
Akane : ...Oh so
You've made three wishes come true in that movie, right? What would Haru wish for?

00:06:41.343 --> 00:06:46.343
Haru : Hmm ... if you can live as usual, that's fine

00:06:46.587 --> 00:06:49.495
Akane : Why do you say that～? There's something more

00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:52.501
Haru : You say so, but what does Akane hope for?

00:06:52.906 --> 00:06:59.900
Akane : After all, I want to be a body that doesn't get fat no matter how much I eat ~ I also want money because I want to buy clothes and cosmetics ...

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:02.208
Oh, wouldn't it be nice if I could use magic?

00:07:02.403 --> 00:07:04.257
Haru : That's sly!

00:07:04.604 --> 00:07:09.000
Then I want to be taller and smarter, and ...
